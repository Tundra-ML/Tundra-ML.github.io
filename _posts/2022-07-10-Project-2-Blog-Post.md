#Project 2

Link to Project:

• what would you do differently?

I would probably spend more time trying a lot of different models. I’d
also like to check how much we gain by each variable and let that help
create our model. There were some techniques from ST518 that I really
wanted to try out.

• what was the most difficult part for you?

The most difficult part for me was getting an idea of what the data
looked like so I could have some meaningful choices on what to touch.

• what are your big take-aways from this project?

My big take away is to establish a template for formatting both with the
data and the actual document so that there is no need to go back through
and check.

I think my partner and I worked really well together. Evan definitely
knew what he was doing with the code and it was nice to use him as a
reference for accomplishing certain things.
