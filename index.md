Hey I'm a late 20 something individual that's interested in the applications of machine learning and data science.

My first posts will most likely be focused on R, but hopefully that will grow to Python and specific packages.

I enjoy physical activity and have been an avid weightlifter for most of my life. I enjoy playing most sports and spent about two years practicing Muay Thai.

I enjoy fantasy novels and video games in my free time. I am a big fan of Dota2.

Hopefully you'll find some things here that either interest you or are useful.
